Lab2

I was unable to get part 2 of the lab to work properly, instead my code sorts by the length of the bigrate. I blieve this to be a problem with the job ordering and was unable to find a solution to the job ordering that would enable me to properly get the code to run.

To get past bigrams spanning multiple lines the can easily be split amongst lines and accounting for the first word of each line being duplicated in a sense.
